# startup items, et cetera are all intended to be handled by mate.

# - wezterm
# - maim + slop + xclip (for taking screenshots)
# - fantasque sans mono
# - symbols nerd font

# logo key
set $mod Mod4

# vim movements
set $left h
set $down j
set $up k
set $right l

# your preferred terminal emulator
set $term wezterm

# your preferred screenshot utility
set $screenshot maim --hidecursor --select | xclip -selection clipboard -target image/png

# workspace names
# these are not displayed anywhere unless you use mate i3 plugin.
# they are used for sorting though.
